            <p>This is a stock analysis program made with Python using the Dash framework. This project taught me some of the fundamentals
              of HTML and web app design. I also improved at pulling data from different types of API's and manipulating it using Pandas and similar libraries.
               There is a section for company metrics, a price chart, an analyst sentiment graph, a volume bubble chart, and a news module.
               A major goal was to learn more about data visualization in Python. I ended up using Plotly and dabbled with Seaborn/Matplotlib, and I 
               feel a lot more confident using them to visualize data now.

            <p>This is a short horror game made in Unity. It was my first full 3D game as I had only made smaller projects before this. 
              The project changed forms a few different times. I learned some lessons about the importance of pre-production planning and attempting to stick to the plan
              to avoid endless feature creep. I think some iteration while designing is a good thing but I wasted a lot time reworking things in hindsight. 
              Main project components were level design, first person controller, interactions by raycast, horror design/events, and monster AI.

            <p>Lava Escape is a puzzle platformer game made in Unreal for a gameplay programming course. You have to keep track of the room's layout and
              change elements between mushrooms that give you a double jump and clouds that disappear after a few seconds. This was my first Unreal game
              and helped me learn the editor and general workflow. I enjoyed visual scripting by Blueprint and look forward to doing more of that in the future.

            <p>UATanks is a multiplayer tank arena game made in Unity. It was made in 5 weeks for a programming course
              and I learned a lot in that time. A procedural level generator was created to randomize the map's layout.
              The enemy AI followed state machine logic for decision-making and one of them used waypoint pathfinding to navigate.
              I also added split-screen multiplayer which was trickier than expected. I ran into some interesting issues like
              considering where to put the only audio listener when both players needed to be able to hear at the same volume.

            <p>This is a game I made for the Itch.io Weekly Game Jam #235. The theme was <em>Bandit</em> and I settled on a simple idea pretty quickly.
              The biggest lesson I learned making this game was to prototype the main game mechanics to make sure the gameplay is solid / fun 
              before making art and assets. I did the process in reverse and didn't spend nearly enough time on the core gameplay loop.
              As a result, the first iteration was too easy and a few people that left feedback said as much. 
              I ended up changing the game so that you only had four knives which had to be picked up whether you hit or miss. 
              I also improved the thief AI a bit. The result is a lot more challenging and could be expanded upon.
